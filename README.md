## Evolutionary Timeline in Flight - Documentation

### Description ###

This visualization illustrates the history of the universe within the persepctive of a flight from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Boston Logan (BOS).


### Motivation ###

I created this project as a Mother's Day gift to my mom, an Evolutionary Biology professor at UCLA. My mom has often encouraged me and her students to look beyond human exceptionalism and appreciate how small a role humankind has played within the history and evolution of the universe. Over break, she showed me a video infographic from Business Insider which she loved and wanted to use for her classes so I decided that I would secretly create a similar visualization for this CS course's final project. I believe this project is a fitting blend of my personal research interests in cartography and my mom's Evolutionary Biology work. 

Given that the deadline for this project falls on Mother's Day, I hope this will make for both a wonderful end to this CS course as well as a hopefully well-recieved Mother's Day gift for my mom (fingers crossed!).

## Components ###
 
I changed the original graphic from LAX to JFK to a flight path from LAX to BOS which more accurately reflected my own journey from Los Angeles originally to Cambridge, MA. A significant number of changes were added in creating this project to the orginial infographic including but not limited to the manipulatability of time/event sliders, emoji-based stopping points, and functionality for other flight paths to name just a few.
