Process
  * Step 0: Find the template for a plane flying in Mapbox. Change the style of the map to be more my taste.
  * Step 1: Re-routing the plane from LAX-JFK to LAX-BOS
  * Step 2: Create the 3 sliders connected to data so that when you moved the slider the text changed for that slider
  * Step 3: Linking the sliders together so they would always refer to the same point in time
  * Step 4: Making the plane move when you changed the sliders
  * Step 5: Making sliders move as the plane moved through its animation
  * Step 6: Add an Emoji dropdown for kicks
  * Step 7: Add an autocomplete that searches within dates
  * Step 8: Style the autocomplete to make it fit with my look

* Technical
  * Autocomplete: choosing the item vs clicking on the magnifying glass
  * How linked should the sliders be? More linked more work but better experience
  * Should the airplane operate independently from the sliders?
  * How many emojis is too many emojis?
  * How exact should the autocomplete search? Substring, regular expression, exact match

* Ethical
  * Evo bio? too controversial?
  * The subjectiveness of the timeline
  * Why is the map US-centered?
  * Plane-phobia .... are we driving people to suicide?

* Scaling
  * If too many people use it Mapbox blocks us
